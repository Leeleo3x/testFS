\section{Project Overview}
In this section we provide an overview of our project by enumerating our goals,
describing the primary challenges we faced, and highlighting the key ideas
behind our approach to addressing these challenges to meet our goals.

\subsection{Project Goals}
The high level goal of our project is to explore the feasibility and
performance implications of enabling parallel access to NVMe storage devices in
a user space file system. We work toward this goal by integrating SPDK with
testFS. More concretely, in our project we aim to:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Demonstrate the feasibility of using SPDK to interact with NVMe devices
    in testFS.
  \item Modify the testFS write path to leverage the ability to make
    asynchronous block writes with multiple threads.
  \item Quantify the performance improvements of an asynchronous write path by
    benchmarking our implementation.
\end{enumerate}
