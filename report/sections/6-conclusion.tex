\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this work was to explore the feasibility of using SPDK to interact
with NVMe devices as well as to quantify the potential performance benefits of
a file system designed for NVMe-based devices. To that end we extended testFS
to support NVMe devices by using SPDK and modified the file system's write
path.

To leverage the parallelism offered by NVMe devices, our key idea was to adopt
a multi-threaded architecture to be able to submit asynchronous I/O requests
for different types of data (e.g. inodes versus data) in parallel by using
distinct threads. Our experiments showed that our design offered up to a
$1.5\times$ improvement for single file writes and up to a $3\times$
improvement for multi-file writes when compared to a write path that used
synchronous I/O. Our hope is that this work helps inspire the design of the
next generation of file systems that are built to leverage the performance
offered by NVMe devices.
