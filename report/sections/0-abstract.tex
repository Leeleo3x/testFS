Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) based solid state devices have undergone
tremendous innovation---leading to significant increases in performance.
However file systems have been slow to keep up; in many cases their design
(kernel space and lock based) impedes their ability to leverage the full
performance offered by NVMe storage devices. So how should next generation file
systems be designed to leverage the performance offered by NVMe storage
devices?

In this work we take a first step towards answering this question by extending
an existing user space file system to support NVMe storage devices by using
SPDK---a user space, polled, lockless device driver. We additionally modify the
file system's write path to support multi-threaded asynchronous I/O. The key
idea behind our design is to use a multi-threaded architecture to be able to
submit asynchronous I/O requests for different types of file system blocks
(e.g.  metadata versus data) in parallel.

Through experiments, we show that our multi-threaded asynchronous write
path is able to offer up to a $1.5\times$ improvement for single file writes
and up to a $3\times$ improvement for multi-file single transaction writes when
compared to a write path implemented with synchronous I/O.
