  Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) based solid state devices has undergone tremendous innovation and
  the performance of storage devices has been increasing significantly. However the current design of
  file systems impedes utilizing the full performance of NVMe storage devices.

  In this report, we present a user level filesystem designed for NVMe storage devices which improve
  the performance by writing different types of blocks in parallel. Our experimental results highlight 
  the effectiveness of using asynchronous I/O write path in improving performance on both single 
  file writes and multi-file writes.
