\section{Reproducing our Results}
Our code is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Leeleo3x/testFS}.
To build and run our code, you need to first install {\tt cmake}. Then
follow the steps in the code repository readme to build and run testFS.

To run our experiments, type {\tt run-experiments} on the testFS REPL. This
command will run all the experiments we used to create the charts in this
project report. The experiments will take roughly 30 minutes to complete. The
raw data will be saved in {\tt .csv} files in the same directory as where the
testFS binary is stored.

Individual benchmarks can be executed with the {\tt bench} command on the
testFS REPL.
